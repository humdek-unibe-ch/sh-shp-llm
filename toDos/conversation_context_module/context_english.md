### Understanding Anxiety and Anxiety Disorders

After the initial questions about motivation and explanations of how the program works, we can now get into the content - starting with some basic information about the feeling of anxiety.

One of the most common questions from people suffering from severe anxiety is: "Why do I suffer from these anxieties in particular?" - The answer is understandably multifaceted and complex. Research has not yet identified clear cause-effect relationships. However, in recent years, many answers have been found that have also proven useful for treatment. We would like to inform you about these findings in this session.

It is important to understand anxiety and anxiety disorders precisely. In the psychotherapeutic treatment of anxiety disorders, it often happens that anxiety is significantly reduced when a precise understanding is developed. In this case, the understanding could be about possible causes and especially those factors that maintain and intensify the anxiety.

Before we get into explanations and models of anxiety disorders, we would like to briefly inform you about the appearance and prevalence of Social Anxiety Disorder. Many sufferers are not aware that they are not alone. Many people suffer from an anxiety disorder throughout their lives. All these people are and will not be "crazy" because of this.

#### Appearance - Social Anxiety Disorder

The core of Social Anxiety Disorder, also called Social Phobia, is the fear of standing out, embarrassing oneself, appearing inappropriate, or performing poorly. One fears saying something inappropriate in conversations with others, or behaving awkwardly in other ways. Or one fears that others will notice the anxiety through blushing, trembling, or sweating.

Since these fears are associated with strong anxiety and tension, most sufferers avoid social situations, even if avoidance has negative long-term consequences. These include professional disadvantages and impairments in relationships with friends, acquaintances, or partners. The more avoidance spreads in everyday life, the greater the anxiety becomes. Long-term, social anxieties often cause additional problems such as loneliness, depression, and discouragement.

#### Prevalence - How many people suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder?

After depression and alcohol dependence, Social Anxiety Disorder is the third most common mental disorder. Almost every seventh person (13%) suffers from it during their lifetime, although exact figures vary depending on the definition of Social Anxiety Disorder and culture.

Although about equal numbers of men and women seek professional help for their social anxieties, based on surveys in the general population, it can be assumed that women suffer from social anxieties somewhat more frequently than men. However, women seek professional help less frequently than men. Possibly, men are still under greater professional and social performance pressure in Western societies than women. They are therefore more forced to seek help. For women, the threshold for seeking professional help may be higher.

In many sufferers, social anxieties have existed for a long time, usually since childhood or puberty. Sometimes the anxieties appear only in adulthood or the exact onset cannot be determined. Anxiety in the presence of others is a widespread phenomenon and initially normal. Only when anxiety becomes very intense and leads to significant impairments in lifestyle does one speak of Social Anxiety Disorder or Social Phobia.

### Causes

Why do people develop an anxiety disorder? What are the causes and triggers? - There is no simple answer. The causes for the development of anxiety disorders are multifaceted and different from person to person.

Anxiety fundamentally represents a biologically useful reaction with high survival value, as anxiety signals danger and helps to avoid it. It is therefore not surprising that there is a biological or genetic basis for anxiety. Part of the pronounced anxiety is inherited. The other part can be attributed to the environment or individual life experiences. Parental behavior and specific "traumatic" experiences also play a shaping role.

Inherited biological risk factors and formative experiences in childhood and youth represent so-called vulnerability factors for the development of an anxiety disorder. They can make a person more "vulnerable" and thus increase the likelihood that someone develops an anxiety disorder. However, an anxiety disorder usually occurs only when burdens and stress are added in everyday life, at work, or in the family.

#### Predisposition

Research shows that part of a person's anxiety is inherited. I.e., some people are "naturally" more anxious than others. It is further assumed that not a specific anxiety disorder is inherited, i.e., there is no biological predisposition for Social Anxiety Disorder. Rather, general emotionality and sensitivity to anxiety are inherited. There are people who are very sensitive and emotional from birth, people who are not sensitive at all, and the majority lies somewhere in between. People with anxiety disorders are typically very sensitive. The disadvantage of high sensitivity is that it makes one vulnerable to the development of an anxiety disorder. The advantage is that people with this personality trait can typically empathize well with others and are often warm, understanding, and trustworthy.

Changing inherited sensitivity and emotionality is very difficult (if not impossible). The program therefore does not aim to change them. That would not be good and also not necessary! Firstly, your emotionality and sensitivity make you a unique person. You would disappoint your acquaintances if you suddenly became a different person. And secondly, high sensitivity does not mean that excessive anxiety must develop and cannot be changed.

In this program, the focus will be on better coping with the negative consequences of high anxiety sensitivity, i.e., the excessive and uncontrollable anxiety. The positive sides, such as your empathy, should be preserved.

#### Environment/Life Experiences

Based on your genes, you are probably a relatively sensitive and emotional person. This does not yet explain the development of an anxiety disorder, since many sensitive people do not suffer from pronounced anxiety. Why do some people develop mental problems and others not? - The answer can probably be found in the environment: Circumstances and individual experiences decide what becomes of high sensitivity.

##### Educational Influences

Among the experiences that influence anxiety readiness are familial educational and relationship patterns. Interestingly and contrary to some assumptions, anxiety disorders are typically NOT associated with particularly difficult childhoods, violence in upbringing, sexual assaults, or particularly hard fates according to various studies. Rather, the parents of anxious adults are often described as particularly caring, sometimes controlling. In other words: The parents were very caring in many cases. They were sometimes experienced as interfering and restrictive.

Before you run to your parents and blame them for your anxiety, it is important to mention that you probably did not become anxious because your parents were very caring and controlling. It is just as likely that parents become very caring when their child is sensitive. Possible causes and effects reinforce each other in a vicious circle and there are understandable reasons why parents behave in a certain way. It makes no difference for treatment whether it happened exactly that way or not.

##### Learning through Observation and Specific Experiences

Parents or other close persons provide important role models. Many anxious behaviors can be learned through observation and imitation of the behavior of important reference persons. Observational learning can, in contrast to relatively unspecific inherited sensitivity to anxiety, possibly determine which type of anxiety disorder develops.

Many socially anxious people have socially anxious parents. As an example, here is a 12-year-old girl who came to therapy because she worried extremely about making mistakes. She tried to do everything perfectly because of this, which also prevented her from enjoying life. She came to the first session with her parents half an hour early. When asked why they were so early, the mother said: "We absolutely wanted to make sure we wouldn't be late."

In addition to observational learning, single specific experiences can contribute to the development of an anxiety disorder. For example, many panic patients report traumatic, life-threatening suffocation experiences in their life histories, such as almost drowning or almost choking on coughing fits or swallowing. People with Social Anxiety Disorder, on the other hand, often report social "traumas", such as being laughed at by classmates because of different appearance (e.g., overweight, acne, ears/noses), unusual names or accents being mocked, being publicly criticized by teachers, receiving a harsh rejection at the first flirt, or experiencing noticeable physical symptoms (sweating, trembling, blushing) when speaking, eating, drinking, or writing in front of others.

##### Stress and Strain

Predisposition, upbringing, observational learning, and specific experiences can make a person more vulnerable or vulnerable to developing an anxiety disorder. However, a disorder usually occurs only when burdensome events are added in everyday life, work, or family. Many sufferers of strong anxiety report that they were heavily burdened and stressed in everyday life or work before the onset of the disorder. For example, they had just moved, had partnership problems, separation, divorce and their consequences, had to care for disabled children or sick relatives, or had started a new job. But even positive events like weddings or births can subjectively be a burden and precede the outbreak of an anxiety disorder.

Strong anxiety ultimately represents a massive stress reaction that prepares us for high-performance action in dangerous, burdensome, and new situations. The close connection between stress and the increased likelihood of experiencing uncontrollable anxiety and worry is therefore not surprising. When a person has to cope with a lot of work or a profound change, it takes less to break the system and develop an even more massive stress reaction. This could be the development of massive anxiety in social situations up to a panic attack. Even after the outbreak of an anxiety disorder, many sufferers report that anxiety symptoms intensify when they are stressed and tense due to external factors such as work or partnership. In phases in which sufferers are less burdened in everyday life, they often report good days on which they have less anxiety, are internally more balanced, and dare more.

The connection between general stress and an increased likelihood of experiencing uncontrollable anxiety and worry is often depicted in psychology using the so-called stress model of anxiety (see Figure 1). The figure shows a yellow shaded area that represents general tension and chronic stress on the left and right. This refers to tension and stress that must be endured for weeks, months, or even years. Factors that increase the general stress and tension level include, for example, mobbing at work, moving to another city, partnership problems, separation/divorce and their consequences, caring for a disabled child or sick relatives, a complicated pregnancy, a chronic illness, the death of close relatives, etc.

For treatment, it means that in addition to working on anxiety patterns, the chronic stress level in everyday life should also be lowered. This reduces the likelihood of intense anxiety and makes anxiety patterns better controllable and influenceable. Therefore, it is important that you also try to lower your general stress level in everyday life alongside the program implementation.

### The Three Levels of Anxiety

Anxiety is accompanied by reactions on three levels. Since all levels are addressed in the treatment of anxiety disorders, an understanding of the three levels should be developed here. The three reaction levels are:

- the physical or physiological sensations
- the thoughts or cognitions
- the motor or behavioral level

Further information

The anxiety reactions on the three levels ultimately aim to prepare the organism rapidly for maximum performance and protection in dangerous situations. Although the anxiety reactions on the three levels are connected, the significance of the individual components differs from person to person. Some perceive more the physical components of anxiety, while others perceive more the thought and behavioral level. The three levels of anxiety are explained in more detail below.

#### The Physical Level

Anxiety excites parts of the so-called vegetative or autonomic nervous system, which largely controls many bodily processes automatically, i.e., automatically and without voluntary control. This includes functions of the heart and circulation, respiration, stomach and intestines, as well as skin and glands. The autonomic nervous system consists of two subdivisions or branches, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic.

The sympathetic is a fight-flight system that is activated in a shock and danger situation and releases energy. The parasympathetic provides relaxation and resets the body after activation of the sympathetic.

Activation of the sympathetic in a danger situation leads to the release of chemical messengers and stress hormones. These include above all adrenaline, but also norepinephrine, cortisol, and cortisone, which rapidly cause changes in various organs. As preparation for physical activity, the heartbeat is strengthened and the heart rate increased, which accelerates blood circulation and improves the transport of oxygen to the tissue and the removal of metabolic products from the tissue. At the same time, blood vessels constrict in places where blood is not immediately needed, for example in the skin, at the fingers and toes. The skin thus often looks pale during anxiety. In addition, fingers and toes often become cold and feel numb and tingling.

In dangerous situations, blood is primarily transported to the large muscles, such as the thighs and biceps. This helps prepare for fight or flight. Since the tissue needs more oxygen in these moments, breathing is also accelerated with activation of the sympathetic. The accelerated breathing can be associated with the impression of shortness of breath or even suffocation and pain and pressure in the chest. With the anxiety reaction, the oxygen supply to the brain is also temporarily reduced somewhat (our ancestors did not need to think during flight). The reduced supply to the brain can be associated with a whole series of unpleasant but harmless symptoms, such as dizziness, daze, blurred vision, feelings of unreality, and heat or cold waves.

A whole series of other physical symptoms are produced by activation of the sympathetic, such as increased sweating, decreased salivation, tense muscles, and decreased activity of the digestive system. The fight-flight reaction thus also causes a dry mouth, tension, and a heaviness in the stomach or constipation. Two aspects are important to know in connection with activation of the sympathetic:

Firstly, after a certain time, the parasympathetic nervous system is always and automatically activated again, providing relaxation. Anxiety cannot continue forever or escalate endlessly. The body does not go beyond its performance limits in automatic reactions. The parasympathetic provides protection that stops the sympathetic. More about this in this session in the chapter "Treatment".

Secondly, a certain time is needed until chemical substances such as adrenaline or norepinephrine released with activation of the sympathetic are broken down. After an anxiety reaction and even when the danger has passed, you feel tense and excited for a while because the substances are still in the blood. The physical symptoms after an anxiety reaction are absolutely natural and harmless. This functioning has proven useful for our ancestors in the free nature, where danger often recurred.

#### The Mental Level

Our mood, our feelings, and our behavior are strongly influenced by how we think about things. When thinking "I embarrass myself in front of others," anxiety and shame can arise. When thinking about loved ones possibly suffering something, anxiety and despair can be triggered. People evaluate all their experiences. These interpretations or thoughts largely determine what and how intensely we feel.

Imagine you are hiking up a mountain. Even if your heart beats faster, you are not worried because you think the faster heartbeat can be explained by the exertion. If the faster heartbeat occurs in another situation, e.g., when you are sitting on the sofa at home, the heartbeat can trigger worrying thoughts. The same symptom can be evaluated completely differently and thus lead to completely different feelings.

Sometimes our thoughts, evaluations, and interpretations are not correct and trigger unjustified anxiety, shame, sadness, despair, or anger. When we encounter a laughing person on the street and think we are being laughed at, unfounded negative feelings can arise. The evaluation of our experiences and experiences can consist not only of individual thoughts, but also of veritable "self-talks." Self-talks like: "I can't do it, I never could, and I never will" can convey a bad mood and strongly hinder successful coping with everyday life.

Anxious people often make many negative thoughts before and not only during a difficult situation. They imagine what could go wrong. This is why they are often tense and anxious beforehand. Also after a difficult situation, they often make many negative thoughts. As a result, a situation is often evaluated more negatively in retrospect than during the situation. Such negative thoughts and self-talks substantially contribute to the intensification and maintenance of anxiety.

#### The Behavioral Level

In addition to the physical and mental level, anxiety feelings also have a motor or behavioral level. For example, anxiety and restlessness on a motor level are often accompanied by trembling or an unsteady voice. Due to the strong excitement, a strong urge to act often arises, which can manifest in restless walking around. On the other hand, anxiety can also paralyze: The person is like frozen and incapable of action. Frequently, concentration and perseverance are also impaired. Performances that require concentration or skill, e.g., reading, completing a difficult task, or speaking in front of others, are impaired by this. On the behavioral level, anxiety is often associated with avoiding or fleeing from anxiety-triggering situations. Some people learn to avoid situations in which they experience anxiety fundamentally, or which they think they would experience anxiety in. Others leave the situations in which they get anxious. They run away.

If an anxiety-triggering situation cannot be avoided, so-called safety behavior can often be observed. This means that many people can only endure anxiety-triggering situations if they always carry certain aids or show certain behaviors that give them a certain security. Examples of such aids are constantly carrying water against nausea or a sedative "for emergencies." Already the knowledge of carrying these aids conveys a feeling of security and makes people braver. Other safety behaviors are sitting ready to flee near the door, moving as little as possible, preparing a speech or lecture very well, practicing and memorizing sentences or statements internally beforehand, or sitting in a corner and by no means in the middle at a restaurant. In general, it can be said that avoidance and safety behavior make people even more prone to anxiety and decisively contribute to the maintenance of anxiety.

### What Maintains Anxiety?

While you continue to work through this session, we ask you to continue identifying anxiety-triggering situations and topics and note them in the corresponding protocol.

So far, possible causes of excessive anxiety have been presented. More important for treatment is the question of how anxiety is maintained in the here and now. The maintaining factors explained below are what the present program focuses on.

#### Negative Thoughts

Anxiety disorders are always associated with many negative thoughts and fears that immediately intensify anxiety in various processes and negatively affect behavior. These anxiety-enhancing processes are explained in more detail in connection with the vicious cycle of anxiety. Here, typical thoughts associated with anxiety disorders are first listed.

##### Typical Negative Thoughts in Social Anxieties

Typical thoughts and fears of socially anxious people are that others consider them stupid, that they start stuttering when they contribute in a discussion round, or that they embarrassingly stand out in social situations through sweating or trembling.

Typically, socially anxious people play through negative thoughts before they enter a difficult situation. They think about what could go wrong and how they could cope with the situation. This is why they are often tense and anxious beforehand.

In the situation, socially anxious people then make negative thoughts about how they come across and paint pictures of what others think about them. Afterwards, they review the situation once more and make many thoughts about the impression they left.

It is an important goal of the most effective therapy form for anxiety disorders, cognitive behavioral therapy, to identify and change the problematic thoughts.

#### Self-Focused Attention

An important role in maintaining anxiety disorders is played by certain attention processes that are scientifically well proven in people with anxiety disorders.

For anxious people, the so-called self-focused attention is typical. Here, attention is directed one-sidedly to internal events, i.e., to one's own feelings, to one's own body, to one's own thoughts, but also to one's own behavior. Less attention is paid to what is "out there" around one. In other words: Sufferers observe themselves very strongly.

In people with Social Anxieties, this manifests in the fact that they focus mainly on their own behavior before and during socially threatening situations ("I will say something stupid and stutter"), their own appearance and the impression they make on others ("Others see that I am nervous"), the physical symptoms ("I am starting to sweat") and the feelings ("Oh no, my anxiety is increasing again. I can't stand this").

A reinforced self-focused attention has various important disadvantages:

The concentration on one's own body intensifies the occurrence of physical symptoms that one actually wants to prevent. For example, if you focus on your face and try to prevent blushing, this intensifies the blushing. Other symptoms of nervousness such as trembling, sweating, or increased heartbeat can also be intensified through excessive self-attention. Furthermore, physical sensations that are normally completely unnoticed (e.g., slight headaches, slight dizziness after a cup of coffee, slightly increased heartbeat) are brought to the center of consciousness and perceived much more intensely than usual. The observation and monitoring of oneself thus has a contrary effect.

If you direct your attention entirely to yourself, you do not perceive the environment. Many, also positive things that happen around you, are missed. Instead, sufferers use their own symptoms and thoughts as information to assess how dangerous a situation is, what could happen, or how one comes across to others. Due to the anxiety and the physical symptoms associated with it, sufferers mostly come to the conclusion that a situation is negative, threatening, or dangerous. For example, if you focus mainly on your negative feelings (the anxiety/nervousness) and not on the reaction of the audience when giving a lecture, you must conclude that the lecture is bad and you come across negatively. Even then, when the audience actually reacts quite positively. The described process can thus lead to serious misjudgments of the situation.

The occupation with oneself binds attention capacities. This makes it difficult to react spontaneously and appropriately to the requirements of a situation. One feels easily overwhelmed and cannot think clearly.

In addition to the increased self-attention, it has been shown that sufferers react very sensitively to potentially dangerous situations and events in the environment and automatically direct their attention rapidly and long to potentially threatening stimuli. For example, if a socially anxious person encounters a group of people, this person will focus more on the bored and annoyed faces and less on the smiling faces.

Since the described attention processes decisively contribute to the maintenance of anxiety, this session deals with these mostly automatic processes under "Treatment".

#### Avoidance and Safety Behavior

Understandably, sufferers try to avoid anxiety-triggering situations or avoid them. Short-term, this reduces anxiety. Long-term, however, the negative thoughts, expectations, and fears are not checked and anxiety is maintained. Furthermore, avoidance leads to restrictions in life and not being able to do certain things anymore. This often leads to additional problems such as discouragement and loneliness.

Examples of situations and behaviors that socially anxious people avoid are:

- Talking to strangers
- Speaking to authorities
- Expressing one's own opinion
- Expressing oneself in a group/meeting
- Speaking in public
- Drinking, writing, eating, or telephoning in public
- Entering a room where others are already sitting
- Oral exams
- Attending meetings
- Attending parties or celebrations

If anxiety-triggering situations cannot be avoided, many sufferers try to avert the feared catastrophe with so-called safety behavior.

If a socially anxious person cannot avoid contributing in a group (e.g., introduction round), they will probably practice the sentence they will say several times in their head. If they cannot avoid attending a party despite anxiety, they might sit in a corner throughout the evening. Thus, they avoid coming into contact with anyone. Or they only talk about things they are good at. Then they avoid meeting new people. Their safety behavior can even be more subtle: For example, they choose clothing that is as inconspicuous as possible to avoid standing out. Or they cool their face frequently with cold water to prevent possible blushing. Etc.

Safety behavior contributes to the maintenance of anxiety in various ways:

Safety behavior prevents experiences from being made that completely and fundamentally question the anxieties and fears. If sentences are prepared in the head in discussion rounds (= safety behavior), a socially anxious person will say to themselves after the discussion: "It only worked because I had prepared every sentence exactly in advance." The fear of not being able to react spontaneously in discussion rounds is not questioned by this.

Safety behavior often has the opposite effect. I.e., the feared consequences that were actually supposed to be prevented occur even more often. For example, if socially anxious people speak quickly to avoid follow-up questions, they often do not notice that the quick speaking makes understanding more difficult and actually provokes follow-up questions. A reinforcement of the symptomatology through safety behavior also occurs often through the increased self-attention associated with it. If you constantly check whether you have taken all safety measures, have everything with you, have prepared well, control body symptoms, and make a good impression, this requires self-observation and intensifies anxiety as already mentioned.

Safety behavior can also simply be harmful. For example, sedatives and alcohol taken to reduce anxiety suppress the symptoms for a few hours, but lead to dangerous dependence in the long term.

Since avoidance and safety behavior decisively contribute to the maintenance of anxiety, this session contains further information about these behaviors under "Treatment".

### Vicious Cycle of Anxiety

Scientific investigations have shown that a vicious cycle between various components of anxiety develops in people suffering from severe anxiety. Anxiety is thereby rapidly escalated and maintained.

Below, we want to explain the vicious cycle of anxiety in more detail.

#### The Vicious Cycle in Social Anxieties

Triggers of Social Anxieties are upcoming, current, or past social situations that trigger certain fears or negative thoughts (see Figure 2).

A socially anxious person who has to give a lecture next week might think that they will stutter, lose the thread, tremble, and be criticized for the lecture. A socially anxious man who sees an attractive woman in the disco might think that the woman definitely doesn't want anything to do with him, that he will stammer and make a fool of himself if he approaches her, etc. A woman who has just met her neighbor might think afterwards that she made a stupid remark, blushed, and that the neighbor now thinks she is strange.

As can be seen from Figure 2, these negative thoughts and expectations typically go hand in hand with three types of processes:

First, these thoughts generate or intensify anxiety or anxiety symptoms such as palpitations, tension, breathing difficulties, trembling, sweating, blushing, or concentration problems.

Second, the person tries to reduce anxiety through avoidance and safety behavior and avert the danger. To not lose the thread, a socially anxious person might formulate a lecture completely. And during the lecture, they might try to hide their hands so that the trembling is not noticed. The man who wants to approach the woman in the disco might not do it at all, i.e., avoid it fundamentally, or drink himself courage, practice the first sentence "in his head", wait for the "best moment", etc. The woman who has just met her neighbor might avoid her neighbor in the future and, if this is not possible, end the conversation prematurely and hide her face behind the collar of her jacket so that possible blushing is not visible.

Third, the person directs attention increasingly to themselves, to their own thoughts and feelings, and focuses on how they come across outwardly. Often, exaggerated vivid images of oneself arise through the increased self-attention. For example, socially anxious people have imagined themselves stumbling during a lecture, starting to stutter, and the others first looking confused and then starting to laugh. The man who wants to approach the woman in the disco sees himself stammering and blushing and imagines his friends making fun of him. Many of these images are connected to traumatic experiences from the past. Memories of critical teachers, failures in the classroom, or mocking classmates come up.

The actual vicious cycle in Social Anxieties arises from the fact that negative thoughts, safety behavior, anxiety symptoms, and self-focused attention mutually escalate each other. If you constantly check your own effect on others to avert possible embarrassments (= safety behavior), you direct attention to yourself, observe yourself internally, and deal with how nervous or anxious you seem, or how you look. The vivid images of yourself associated with the increased self-attention can reinforce safety behavior again. The person who sees themselves stammering during the lecture might cling even more to the pre-formulated text. At the same time, even worse is feared, thoughts begin to race (e.g.: "I have to abort the lecture", "I can't take it anymore", "I'm going to pass out"), which in turn intensifies anxiety symptoms and further increases the focus of attention on these symptoms.

### Personal Explanatory Model

In this session, you have received a lot of information about possible causes but also about maintaining factors of anxiety. Take time now and think about how the psychological findings mentioned in this session can help you understand your anxiety.

In the first protocol, you specifically described your thoughts, attention, and behavior before or during a difficult situation for you.

Based on the depiction of the vicious cycle and your knowledge that you have acquired so far, you can use the space in the PDF to work out your understanding of your anxieties in social situations. Focus on what happens to you in this moment, how anxiety functions, and how it is maintained. To answer these questions, it can be helpful to reread the various explanations. The questions in the PDF serve as guidance for you.

### Treatment

For the treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder, so-called cognitive behavioral therapy is one of the most effective treatment methods. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a scientifically recognized form of psychotherapy. Problematic thinking and behavioral patterns are identified and changed in therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy is based on the principle that the way we think about things influences our behavior and emotions, not the things themselves. The techniques promote self-awareness (i.e., more awareness of how we think) and change unrealistic and unhelpful thought processes. When we think differently, we also change our emotions and behavior. This approach can be applied to all mental disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder basically consists of four treatment components, i.e., four areas addressed in therapy. In this area, you have learned the most important information about Social Anxiety Disorder. Now, more detailed information about the other three areas follows in this chapter, namely "Thinking Realistically", "Training Attention", and "Testing Reality".

If it should be too much information at once, no worries. The contents will be taken up again, repeated, and deepened in the following sessions.

#### Treatment - Thinking Realistically

We want to start this chapter with an example:

Imagine you are invited to a good friend's wedding. He has asked you to give a small speech after the meal. You are very nervous before the speech. Nevertheless, you get up and start the speech. The guests listen attentively and you have the impression that it is not going so badly. Your nervousness also decreases and you get better and better. But towards the end of your speech, during a serious passage, a part of the audience suddenly starts giggling. How would you feel in such a moment? Would you feel ashamed, embarrassed, ridiculous, or angry? How strong would these feelings be?

Now imagine your table neighbor says after the speech: "I think you didn't notice that the waiter behind you stumbled and almost dropped the tray with the glasses." How would you feel now? Still embarrassed, ridiculous, or angry? - Probably not!

The situation was always the same! You gave a speech, part of the audience laughed. What changed was your feeling! Why? - Because you thought something different. First, you might have thought that the audience was laughing at you and that you appeared embarrassing or ridiculous. Later, you realized that the guests were not laughing at you, but at the waiter. You might have thought: "Oh, it was the waiter", and no longer felt bad. The situation did not change! What changed was what you thought. Based on the changed thoughts, you also felt differently. It is thus not only the situation alone that influences how we feel. Our feelings are primarily determined by our interpretation and evaluation of the situation.

Certain situations or certain events may increase the likelihood of certain feelings arising. But this only happens because we are likely to think something specific in certain situations. If a gun is pointed at you, it is very difficult NOT to think that you could be injured or killed. It is therefore also very difficult not to feel anxiety. But even in this example, anxiety is ultimately intensified by the thought "could be killed". If you think, for example, that it is a toy gun, you feel less or no anxiety.

Worrying, negative thoughts and expectations are quite typical for people with strong anxieties. Such thoughts intensify anxiety. Therefore, we consider the negative thoughts, expectations, and interpretations in more detail in this chapter. If we change such thoughts, we change our feelings.

##### Two Notes

Automatic Negative Thoughts

Many negative thoughts and attitudes are not conscious to us. Psychologists call these "automatic thoughts". Automatic thoughts are well learned and activated easily and quickly. Many people think that they simply react emotionally to certain situations and have no thoughts, since the automatic thoughts are so lightning-fast. But even in these situations, thoughts are activated and play a role in the development of feelings. Automatic thoughts are so self-evident that we hardly question them. Precisely because of this, it is important to catch the automatic thoughts. The protocol "Anxiety-triggering situations and topics" that you got to know in this session is suitable for identification. If you regularly ask yourself what went through your head in anxiety-triggering situations, the identification of automatic thoughts will become easier for you.

Thinking realistically does not mean thinking positively

Many people believe that realistic thinking means positive thinking. That's not true! Positive thinking means seeing everything as wonderful and rosy. Life is not always wonderful. Realistic thinking means weighing all evidence for and against a thought. A negative thought can also be realistic. Sometimes we are treated badly by others and sometimes we are laughed at. The point is: If you try to replace the negative ones with realistic thoughts afterwards, the new thoughts should not simply be positive, but realistic. After all, you must also be able to believe in the realistic thoughts.

##### What Do People with Anxiety Disorders Think?

The many negative thoughts found in people with anxiety disorders can often be traced back to certain thinking errors. The most common errors are presented here:

###### Drawing Conclusions from Missing Evidence

People with pronounced anxiety often immediately draw conclusions from a situation. They have absolutely no evidence for the conclusion and have not sufficiently considered other possibilities beforehand. For example, you greet your boss in the morning and he/she does not greet back, and you immediately conclude that he/she is dissatisfied with your work and angry with you. Probably you have no other indications for this assumption besides the short unfriendliness. You overlook that there are alternative explanations for the unfriendliness. For example, your boss might be in a bad mood today because he/she has problems at home or with customers.

###### Certain vs. Possible

People with pronounced anxiety typically overestimate the probability that a negative event will actually occur. They act and feel as if possible negative consequences occur with certainty, instead of being one of several possibilities. They think: "I will definitely appear boring at the party" and not: "At the party, I might tell something more interesting or more boring". Affected people thus make unrealistic assessments that make possible negative consequences appear as certain consequences.

###### Catastrophizing

Affected people overestimate the negative consequences of an event. They assume, for example, that if they briefly lose the thread during a speech, they will be considered stupid and others will never want to have anything to do with them again. Or they think that it would be a terrible catastrophe if they got into an argument with their boss. In short: they catastrophize!

The fact is, however, that mishaps and conflicts belong to our lives. We all make mistakes, have bad days, and usually it's not a big deal. Also, the argument with the boss would be unpleasant in the short term, but after two days your boss would probably not think about the argument anymore.

It is worth practicing realistic assessment of the probability and consequences of negative events.

#### Treatment - Training Attention

Affected people usually do not notice that their attention is directed one-sidedly to internal events before, during, and after anxiety-triggering situations, i.e., to one's own thoughts and feelings and less to what is "out there" around one. The negative effect of this self-focused attention can probably be well understood if a special event interrupts this process. Think of an emergency situation affecting another person. What happens to your attention and your anxieties then? - You will probably notice that you focus fully on the situation (and not on yourself) and that your usual anxieties disappear temporarily.

The "imprisonment" in one's own world is often very difficult to interrupt for people with pronounced anxiety. It is therefore important to become aware of the self-focused attention and gain more control over these processes. You should therefore practice directing attention increasingly outwards, to the environment and to the actual task, and break the habitually established, harmful self-attention.

##### Detached Mindfulness

Affected people of strong anxiety often concentrate, often almost constantly, on potentially threatening things. They go through in their minds again and again what has happened and what could happen. This constant thinking about threatening situations understandably does not contribute to distancing oneself mentally from an anxiety-triggering situation or event and reducing anxiety.

Imagine you cut yourself in the kitchen with a knife on your finger. As you know, the wound heals by itself over time. What would happen if you constantly tried to make the wound heal faster by constantly tapping on the scar and constantly washing out the wound? - You would prolong the healing process and perhaps the wound would even become inflamed.

It's the same with anxiety. With the attention directed to possible dangers, the excessive thinking about anxiety-triggering situations, brooding and trying to control the anxiety and thoughts, the healing process is blocked or anxiety is intensified. The goal of attention direction is therefore to distance oneself from the many thoughts, so that one is ultimately less affected by the thoughts. It should be recognized that thoughts are not facts, but "only" thoughts, with which one does nothing, does not react to them, and can even observe them relatively detached.

Many affected people try to control threatening thoughts by trying to suppress and stop them. This attempt to think about something leads to even stronger and more frequent thinking about it. Studies have shown that it is more helpful to try to distance oneself from thoughts and perceive them as mere thoughts. Therefore, detached mindfulness.

#### Treatment - Testing Reality

For most people, questioning negative thoughts is very helpful. Nevertheless, one does not get over the last doubts that something bad could still happen. This is understandable! How often in your life have you really learned something by "only" thinking about it? Did you learn to drive a car by thorough thinking? - Probably not! Perhaps you thought about what you had to do to start driving, but then you got in the car and simply began. First you were probably quite clumsy, but the more you practiced, the better you became.

The same applies to the final overcoming of anxiety. If something makes you nervous, you should think realistically about it first and then go out and try it. You should "test reality". When you test reality, you collect new experiences and current evidence for or against your thoughts. The way out of anxiety ultimately only leads through anxiety. This means that you should face anxiety-triggering situations and endure the anxiety briefly in order to overcome the anxiety in the medium and long term.

##### The Confrontation Principle

When people experience strong anxiety in certain situations, they typically leave these situations very quickly or avoid them altogether. Through leaving or fundamental avoidance of the situation, anxiety is reduced or does not occur. In principle, this behavior only means that they evade the problem and no longer have to deal with it. They have not solved the problem, since they have to restrict themselves and can no longer do certain things.

In Figure 3, the anxiety course associated with this behavior is depicted: When the person enters an anxiety-triggering situation or even thinks about it, anxiety rises. Through leaving or fundamental avoidance of the situation, anxiety decreases again. It is important that affected people often assume that anxiety would rise endlessly if they did not leave the situation. This is shown in Figure 3 with the dotted line. In this context, "fear of fear" is also spoken of. Affected people have fear of the situation as well as fear of the expected extreme anxiety, since they expect anxiety to rise endlessly.

The assumption that anxiety simply rises steadily is wrong however! Without exception and for all people, anxiety settles on a certain level for a short time and then decreases again.

Admittedly: For those affected who do not want to avoid situations or cannot, this anxiety level is initially relatively high. But even for them, anxiety decreases automatically and with each confrontation with the situation and anxiety, the maximum anxiety level decreases. This reaction is called "habituation" or "getting used to" and is built into our body. We get used to anxiety and the situation loses its threat. If we are on a high arousal level for a while, the body regulates itself autonomously, stress is reduced. Perhaps you remember the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system mentioned in the chapter "The Three Levels of Anxiety". The two systems control each other. The parasympathetic ensures that your anxiety is reduced if the sympathetic is activated too strongly or too long. More on this in this session in the chapter "Treatment".

##### One Step at a Time

Remember the 3-year-old Sophie: In the first step, the father held her feet in the water and then went deeper slowly. Only when Sophie relaxed again after a small step and noticed that nothing dangerous was happening did he take the next step. He could have thrown Sophie into the water. As long as she hadn't drowned, she would have gotten used to the water after a while and calmed down. But that would have been quite brutal. Sophie would have lost control for a moment and neither she nor her father would have wanted that. The same applies to you: You could attach a lamp to your head, paint yourself blue, walk through the main street and sing "Brother John". As long as you wouldn't be arrested, you might calm down after a while and notice that nothing bad happens. But starting with something like that would be quite difficult.

A better way to test reality is to start with relatively simple situations. You can increase the difficulty as soon as you notice that a situation no longer causes difficulties. You always keep control by proceeding at your own pace.

##### Stay in the Situation

If you confront yourself with an anxiety-triggering situation, you should stay in the situation until the anxiety has decreased and you feel reasonably relaxed. It will be harder for you to visit a party in the future if you flee from a party as soon as your anxiety reaches its peak, for example. Sometimes, if you find yourself in an unexpectedly difficult situation, you may not succeed in enduring the situation and staying. If you notice that you can't do anything else and have to get out of the situation, do it. That doesn't mean the end of the world and we have to be realistic. "Staying in the situation" is the ideal. In any case, it is better to confront a situation than to do nothing and avoid the situation completely. You can even pat yourself on the back and be proud, even if you "only" tried. Confronting anxiety is not easy.

##### Repetition

Confronting a situation once is usually not enough to overcome anxiety completely. Confrontation with difficult situations must be repeated several times until one can enter the situation relaxed. Repetition is an important element of reality testing.

##### Ups and Downs

Typically, repeated confrontation with a situation leads to a steady decrease in anxiety. However, it must be taken into account that we have good and bad days. Sometimes we feel strong and have a lot of self-confidence. Sometimes we feel weak and insecure. This can have various reasons. Perhaps you slept badly, perhaps something went wrong, and perhaps you simply have a bad mood. It is important that the bad times do not gain the upper hand. A bad day is just what it is: a temporary bad moment. On bad days, you cannot achieve the same as on good days. Think realistically and set your goals a bit lower. The most important thing is that you do something even on bad days. Even if it is less than on good days.
